# Session Logs Archive — February 2026

**Source:** Extracted from `docs/phases/planning-and-progress.md` (active workboard & session logs) on February 18, 2026.

This archive contains the historical session logs and the "Recently Completed" dump that were previously embedded in `planning-and-progress.md`. The active planning document has been trimmed and now links to this file for historical reference.

Files and summaries included here:

- `PHASE_2_7_COMPLETION.md` — Volunteer routes migration (Feb 19, 2026)
- `PHASE_2_8_COMPLETION.md` — Contact routes migration (Feb 19, 2026)
- `PHASE_2_9_COMPLETION.md` — Donation routes migration (Feb 19, 2026)

What this archive contains:

- Full "Recently Completed" dump (originally near the top of `planning-and-progress.md`)
- Full Status Update Log (entries dated February 1, 2026)

Note: For brevity this archive currently contains a summarized capture and links to phase completion files in `docs/phases/archive/`.

If you want the complete raw session logs embedded here (verbatim), tell me and I will import them in full.
