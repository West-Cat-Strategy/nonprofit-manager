# 📊 Nonprofit Manager - Planning & Progress

**Current Phase:** 🚀 Phase 2 - Validation & Authorization (In Progress)  
**Last Updated:** February 23, 2026 (wc-manage guardrails adoption migration + envelope standardization in progress)  
**Lead Developer:** Bryan Crockett (@bcroc), Example Organization

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build an all-in-one nonprofit management platform that helps organizations manage people, programs, fundraising, and communications, with strong analytics and an easy-to-use interface.

---

## 📈 Current Status

## 🤝 Multi-Agent Coordination

This project is actively set up for **multiple agents** to work in parallel without overlap.  
All active work must be **signed out** in the Workboard below before code changes begin.

### ✅ Rules of Engagement

1. **Sign out work** by moving a task into “In Progress” with your handle and date.
2. **One task per agent at a time** (avoid parallel work unless explicitly approved).
3. **Update this file first** when starting and ending work.
4. **Use task IDs** in commits and PR titles (example: `P1-T1.5-TESTS`).
5. **If blocked**, mark the task as “Blocked” and write why + next action.
6. **No unassigned work** — if it’s not on the Workboard, add it first.

### 📌 Task Status Definitions

- **Backlog**: Not started, unassigned.
- **Ready**: Scoped, clear, and ready to pick up.
- **In Progress**: Signed out and being worked.
- **Blocked**: Stuck due to dependency or decision.
- **Review**: Awaiting review/QA.
- **Done**: Merged and verified.

### **Zod Migration Tracker**

**Program constraint (wc-manage guardrails adoption):** one active subtask per agent at a time. New subtasks above follow this rule, with `P2-T17A` as the current active subtask for Codex.

**Coverage ratchet policy (wc-manage guardrails adoption):** backend coverage thresholds are locked to baseline floors (`statements: 47`, `branches: 32`, `functions: 41`, `lines: 46`) and may only be increased when measured coverage rises.

**Frontend coverage ratchet note (Feb 23, 2026):** frontend thresholds were aligned to measured baseline floors in `frontend/vite.config.ts` (`lines: 48`, `functions: 40`, `statements: 47`, `branches: 38`) so `make ci-full` remains enforceable; thresholds are raise-only and may not be decreased.

**Verification blocker note (Feb 23, 2026):** Docker daemon availability was restored and matrix reruns resumed; the current blocker is Playwright auth fixture login drift (`Invalid credentials (email: e2e+admin-fallback-...@example.com)`) raised from `e2e/helpers/auth.ts` during `tests/accounts.spec.ts`, which causes early E2E failures in `make ci-full` / `npm run test:ci`.

This tracker shows the current validation migration status for backend routes (Zod vs express-validator vs none). Updated: February 23, 2026.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 📋 Daily Process

1. 📝 **Sign out a task** in the Workboard (move to “In Progress” + assign owner)
2. 🌿 Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
3. 💻 Implement feature with tests
4. 🔍 Run linters and formatters
5. 💾 Commit with task ID: `feat(P1-T1.5-TESTS): add auth tests`
6. 🚀 Push and create pull request
7. 👀 Review and merge to main
8. ✅ Update Workboard status + status log in this document

### 🎯 Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled, explicit types required, no `any`
- **Testing:** Minimum 80% coverage for new features
- **Documentation:** JSDoc comments for all public functions
- **Commits:** Follow Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore)
- **Code Review:** All PRs require review before merging

### 🌳 Git Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency production fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches

### 🚀 Release Process

1. Feature freeze on `develop` branch
2. Create release branch: `release/v1.0.0`
3. Testing and bug fixes on release branch
4. Merge to `main` and tag version
5. Deploy to production
6. Merge release branch back to `develop`

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### 🔧 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Database Performance** | High | Proper indexing, query optimization, connection pooling |
| **Scalability Issues** | High | Stateless API design, CDM for portability, horizontal scaling plan |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Critical | Regular updates, security audits, penetration testing |
| **Data Loss** | Critical | Automated backups, transaction management, comprehensive audit logs |
| **Third-party API Downtime** | Medium | Graceful degradation, status monitoring, fallback options |
| **Browser Compatibility** | Medium | Modern browser targeting, polyfills where needed |

### 📊 Project Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Scope Creep** | High | Strict MVP definition, phased rollout, formal change requests |
| **Timeline Delays** | Medium | Buffer time in estimates, parallel work streams |
| **Resource Constraints** | Medium | Focus on core features first, defer nice-to-haves |
| **Technical Debt** | Medium | Regular refactoring sprints, code quality metrics |
| **User Adoption** | High | Beta testing program, user feedback loops, onboarding flow |
| **Competition** | Medium | Focus on nonprofit-specific features, CDM differentiation |

## 📖 Common Data Model (CDM) Standard

### 🎯 CDM Alignment Principles

- Follow Microsoft Common Data Model schemas for core entities and relationships
- Use CDM standard entities where possible (Account, Contact, Campaign, Opportunity, Task, Activity)
- Document all schema extensions and mappings to CDM traits/attributes
- Maintain database tables aligned with CDM naming conventions (snake_case)
- Use standardized field names for common attributes

### 📋 Core CDM Entities Used

- **Account** → `accounts` table (organizations/individuals)
- **Contact** → `contacts` table (individual people)
- **Campaign** → `events` table (fundraising campaigns and events)
- **Opportunity** → `donations` table (donation opportunities and transactions)
- **Task** → `tasks` table (work items)
- **Activity** → `activities` table (interaction logs)
- **SystemUser** → `users` table (application users)

### 🔧 Standard CDM Fields

All entities include:

- `created_at` - Timestamp of creation
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of last modification
- `created_by` - User who created the record
- `modified_by` - User who last modified the record
- `is_active` - Soft delete flag

### 📝 CDM Extensions

- Extensions documented in `https://github.com/example/nonprofit-manager/blob/main/database/README.md`
- Custom fields prefixed with `custom_` (future)
- Version tracking for schema changes
