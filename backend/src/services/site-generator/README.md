# Site Generator Module Namespace

This folder provides the public module boundary for site generation.

- Import new code from `services/site-generator`.
- Legacy internals remain under `services/siteGenerator` for backward compatibility.

When migration is complete, internal implementation files can be relocated without
changing consumer imports.
